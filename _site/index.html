		<li>Aegean - Native to the Greek islands known as the Cyclades in the Aegean Sea, these are natural cats, meaning they developed without humans getting involved in their breeding. As a breed, Aegean Cats are rare, although they are numerous on their home islands. They are generally friendly toward people and can be excellent cats for families with children.</li>

		<li>American Curl - Distinguished by truly unique ears that curl back in a graceful arc, offering an alert, perky, happily surprised expression, they cause people to break out into a big smile when viewing their first Curl. Curls are very people-oriented, faithful, affectionate soulmates, adjusting remarkably fast to other pets, children, and new situations.</li>
	
		<li>American Shorthair - The American Shorthair is known for its longevity, robust health, good looks, sweet personality, and amiability with children, dogs, and other pets.</li>
